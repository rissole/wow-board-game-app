1. Chuck your image in the CDN folder of the WoW Board Game Companion folder of Google Drive. For your convenience here's a link to that folder - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13pUEJD1YCs6jUoqBZgqG9XTNFhGLUiHG?usp=sharing
2. Create a shareable link for anyone on the internet for your newly added image, eg. https://drive.google.com/file/d/129JPJ3ksLFOxn_yoEv9F4pw9q4gSdFFe/view?usp=sharing
3. Take the id for that file between the `/d/` and `/view/` path params
4. Create a new link following the format of https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID where FILE_ID is from the public share link
5. Use that link as the path in the code for using that image in the app
